Implement everything (See 'Project Information')
- Design UI
- Design code architecture
- Implement architecture and UI

Immediate Priorities:
1. Mock up basic but functional UI
2. Design code architecture around UI
3. Implement code and UI for first level
4. Rinse and repeat for future versions

Requirements:
* Compatible with newer versions of macOS than, say, 10.8 (Earlier if possible, 10.6 ideal)
    (Will be decided by capabilities of Swift to run backwards)

General Roadmap:
    V1.0 (Navy Vulture):
        * Initial UI
            - Pie charts
            - Averages & monthly currents
            - Recurring and one-off flow
        * Periodic income and expenses
    V2.0:
        * One-off income and expenses
        * Initial setup UI?
        * UI animation
        * Back-and-forth comparison (v1.1?)
    V3.0:
